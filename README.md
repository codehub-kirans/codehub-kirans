âš¡ **Fun fact**: My first programming language was BASIC when I started learning & coding by myself in the fifth grade. And then my first hobby software project was a class marksheet consolidation program that I wrote on my ATARI 8-bit home computer with 64K of RAM connected to a tape drive as a solution when the school messed up the manual tabulation of the leaderboard tally!
